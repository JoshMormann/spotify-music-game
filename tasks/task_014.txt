# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Game Feedback System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to provide clear visual and textual feedback on game actions and outcomes.
# Details:
Implement the game feedback system with the following features:

1. Visual indication of current player turn
2. Detailed explanation of comparison outcomes
3. Score display and updates
4. Game history log
5. Visual and audio cues for important events

```jsx
const GameFeedback = () => {
  const { state } = useGameContext();
  const { playerScore, computerScore, currentTurn, gameHistory } = state;
  
  return (
    <FeedbackContainer>
      <ScoreDisplay>
        <PlayerScore>You: {playerScore}</PlayerScore>
        <ComputerScore>Computer: {computerScore}</ComputerScore>
      </ScoreDisplay>
      
      <TurnIndicator currentTurn={currentTurn}>
        {currentTurn === 'player' ? 'Your Turn' : 'Computer\'s Turn'}
      </TurnIndicator>
      
      {gameHistory.length > 0 && (
        <OutcomeDisplay>
          <h3>Last Round</h3>
          <OutcomeDetails>
            {renderOutcomeDetails(gameHistory[gameHistory.length - 1])}
          </OutcomeDetails>
        </OutcomeDisplay>
      )}
      
      <GameHistoryLog>
        <h3>Game History</h3>
        <HistoryList>
          {gameHistory.map((turn, index) => (
            <HistoryItem key={index} winner={turn.winner}>
              Round {index + 1}: {turn.category.name} - 
              {turn.winner === 'player' ? 'You won' : turn.winner === 'computer' ? 'Computer won' : 'Tie'}
            </HistoryItem>
          ))}
        </HistoryList>
      </GameHistoryLog>
    </FeedbackContainer>
  );
};

const renderOutcomeDetails = (turn) => {
  if (!turn) return null;
  
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        <strong>Category:</strong> {turn.category.name}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Your track:</strong> {turn.playerTrack.name} by {turn.playerTrack.artists[0].name}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Computer's track:</strong> {turn.computerTrack.name} by {turn.computerTrack.artists[0].name}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Result:</strong> {turn.reason}
      </p>
      <WinnerBadge winner={turn.winner}>
        {turn.winner === 'player' ? 'You won this round!' : 
         turn.winner === 'computer' ? 'Computer won this round!' : 'This round was a tie!'}
      </WinnerBadge>
    </>
  );
};
```

Implement animations for score updates and outcome displays to draw attention to important changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test the feedback system with various game states and outcomes. Verify that all information is displayed correctly and updates in real-time. Test with edge cases like ties and very long track/artist names. Ensure the feedback is accessible to screen readers and provides sufficient context for all game events.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Turn Indicator with Visual Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a visually distinct turn indicator component that clearly shows which player's turn it is currently.
### Details:
Enhance the TurnIndicator component with conditional styling based on currentTurn state. Add a pulsing animation effect for the active player. Use contrasting colors for player vs computer turns. Ensure the component is accessible with appropriate aria attributes.

## 2. Develop Animated Score Display [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an animated score display that visually emphasizes score changes when they occur.
### Details:
Modify the ScoreDisplay component to track previous scores and animate transitions when scores change. Implement a subtle scaling or highlighting effect when a player's score increases. Use CSS transitions or React Spring for smooth animations. Add a celebratory effect for milestone scores (e.g., every 5 points).

## 3. Create Detailed Outcome Explanation Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Enhance the outcome display to provide clear, detailed explanations of comparison results with visual emphasis.
### Details:
Expand the renderOutcomeDetails function to include more detailed comparisons between tracks. Add visual indicators showing the specific values being compared (e.g., danceability, energy). Implement a slide-in animation when new outcomes are displayed. Use icons or visual cues to highlight the winning attribute. Style the WinnerBadge component with appropriate colors and animations based on the outcome.

## 4. Implement Scrollable Game History Log with Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create a scrollable, filterable game history log that maintains a record of all game actions and outcomes.
### Details:
Enhance the GameHistoryLog component to support scrolling for long game sessions. Add the ability to filter history by outcome (wins, losses, ties). Implement subtle animations for new entries being added to the history. Use virtualization for performance if the history becomes very long. Add timestamps to history entries. Style history items differently based on outcome.

## 5. Add Audio Feedback and Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Implement audio cues and visual notifications for important game events to enhance user feedback.
### Details:
Create a notification system that plays appropriate sounds for wins, losses, ties, and other significant events. Add subtle sound effects for user interactions (e.g., selecting a card). Implement toast-style notifications for important events that appear briefly and then fade out. Ensure all audio elements have proper controls and respect user preferences. Add a mute toggle option. Create visual equivalents for all audio cues for accessibility.
