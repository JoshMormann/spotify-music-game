   - Release date
   - Cover art URL
   - Tracks array with track details

Example structure:
```javascript

    name: 'Thriller',
    artist: 'Michael Jackson',
    releaseDate: '1982-11-30',
    coverArt: 'https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273112d15add9c5d64578c0f194',
    tracks: [
      {
        id: '5ChkMS8OtdzJeqyybCc9R5',
        name: 'Billie Jean',
        duration: 294053,
        popularity: 88,
        releaseDate: '1982-11-30',
        chartPosition: 1
      },
      // Additional tracks...
    ]
  },
  // Additional albums...
];
```

Ensure each album has complete data for all challenge categories (chart position, play count, release date).
