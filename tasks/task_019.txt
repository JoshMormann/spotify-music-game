# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application for performance, ensuring smooth animations and minimal loading times.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations with the following techniques:

1. Code splitting and lazy loading of components
2. Image optimization and lazy loading
3. Memoization of expensive calculations
4. Efficient rendering with React.memo and useMemo
5. Debouncing of frequent events

```javascript
// Lazy loading of screens
const GameScreen = React.lazy(() => import('./screens/GameScreen'));
const AboutScreen = React.lazy(() => import('./screens/AboutScreen'));

// Optimized router with suspense
const AppRouter = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingScreen />}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<HomeScreen />} />
          <Route path="/game" element={<ProtectedRoute><GameScreen /></ProtectedRoute>} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<AboutScreen />} />
          {/* Other routes */}
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
};

// Memoized components
const AlbumCover = React.memo(({ album, onSelect, isSelected }) => {
  return (
    <AlbumCoverContainer
      onClick={() => onSelect(album)}
      className={isSelected ? 'selected' : ''}
    >
      <LazyLoadImage
        src={album.coverArt}
        alt={`${album.name} by ${album.artist}`}
        effect="blur"
        threshold={100}
      />
      <AlbumInfo>
        <AlbumTitle>{album.name}</AlbumTitle>
        <AlbumArtist>{album.artist}</AlbumArtist>
      </AlbumInfo>
    </AlbumCoverContainer>
  );
});

// Optimized track comparison with memoization
const useTrackComparison = (playerTrack, computerTrack, category) => {
  return useMemo(() => {
    if (!playerTrack || !computerTrack || !category) return null;
    return compareTracksByCategory(playerTrack, computerTrack, category);
  }, [playerTrack, computerTrack, category]);
};

// Debounced event handler
const useDebounce = (value, delay) => {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);
    
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);
  
  return debouncedValue;
};
```

Implement image optimization using responsive images and WebP format where supported.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimizations using Lighthouse or similar tools. Test loading times on various network conditions. Verify that animations run at 60fps. Test memory usage during extended gameplay sessions. Ensure optimizations don't introduce new bugs or regressions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up code splitting and lazy loading for all major components and routes to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading times.
### Details:
Identify all major components and screens that can be lazy loaded. Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for each route in the router. Create appropriate loading fallbacks for each lazy-loaded component. Update the webpack configuration if needed to optimize chunk sizes.

## 2. Optimize Images with Responsive Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement image optimization using responsive images, WebP format, and lazy loading techniques.
### Details:
Convert existing images to WebP format with fallbacks for unsupported browsers. Implement srcset and sizes attributes for responsive images. Use the LazyLoadImage component for all images. Create different sized versions of images for various viewport sizes. Add blur-up loading effect for better perceived performance.

## 3. Implement Memoization for Expensive Calculations [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Apply useMemo and React.memo to prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders throughout the application.
### Details:
Identify components that render frequently but don't need to update. Apply React.memo to these components with appropriate equality checks. Find expensive calculations in the codebase and wrap them with useMemo. Implement custom comparison functions where default shallow comparison is insufficient. Focus on the track comparison logic and other data processing functions.

## 4. Implement Event Debouncing and Throttling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply debouncing and throttling techniques to frequent events like scrolling, resizing, and user input to reduce unnecessary processing.
### Details:
Create reusable useDebounce and useThrottle hooks. Apply debouncing to search inputs, form submissions, and other user inputs. Apply throttling to scroll events, resize handlers, and other continuous events. Ensure proper cleanup of timers in useEffect return functions. Optimize event handlers in list components and scrollable areas.

## 5. Implement Performance Monitoring and Optimization Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Set up performance monitoring tools and metrics to verify the impact of optimizations and identify remaining bottlenecks.
### Details:
Integrate React Profiler to identify unnecessary renders. Set up Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing. Implement Web Vitals tracking to monitor Core Web Vitals. Create a performance dashboard to track metrics over time. Add performance budgets to prevent regressions. Identify and fix any remaining bottlenecks discovered during monitoring.
