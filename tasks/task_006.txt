# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Game State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a context and reducer to manage the game state, including player hands, scores, turn tracking, and game history.
# Details:
Implement a React Context and useReducer pattern for game state management:

1. Create GameContext and GameProvider:
```javascript
const GameContext = createContext();

const initialState = {
  playerAlbums: [],
  computerAlbums: [],
  playerScore: 0,
  computerScore: 0,
  currentTurn: 'player', // 'player' or 'computer'
  selectedAlbum: null,
  selectedTrack: null,
  selectedCategory: null,
  gameHistory: [],
  gameStatus: 'idle', // 'idle', 'playing', 'completed'
  winner: null
};

const gameReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INITIALIZE_GAME':
      return {
        ...initialState,
        playerAlbums: action.payload.playerAlbums,
        computerAlbums: action.payload.computerAlbums,
        gameStatus: 'playing'
      };
    case 'SELECT_ALBUM':
      return { ...state, selectedAlbum: action.payload };
    case 'SELECT_TRACK':
      return { ...state, selectedTrack: action.payload };
    case 'SELECT_CATEGORY':
      return { ...state, selectedCategory: action.payload };
    case 'COMPLETE_TURN':
      return {
        ...state,
        playerScore: action.payload.playerScore,
        computerScore: action.payload.computerScore,
        currentTurn: state.currentTurn === 'player' ? 'computer' : 'player',
        gameHistory: [...state.gameHistory, action.payload.turnResult],
        selectedAlbum: null,
        selectedTrack: null,
        selectedCategory: null
      };
    case 'END_GAME':
      return {
        ...state,
        gameStatus: 'completed',
        winner: action.payload.winner
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

2. Create custom hooks for game actions:
- useGameInitialization
- usePlayerTurn
- useComputerTurn
- useGameCompletion

3. Implement persistence of game state using localStorage to allow resuming games.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the reducer to verify each action correctly updates the state. Test that the game state persists correctly between page refreshes. Create integration tests to verify the full game flow from initialization to completion works correctly with the state management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GameContext and GameProvider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the React Context and Provider components with initial state and reducer function for game state management.
### Details:
Create a new file `GameContext.js` that exports:
1. A GameContext using React's createContext
2. The initialState object with all game state properties
3. The gameReducer function with cases for INITIALIZE_GAME, SELECT_ALBUM, SELECT_TRACK, SELECT_CATEGORY, COMPLETE_TURN, and END_GAME
4. A GameProvider component that wraps children with the context provider and uses useReducer with the gameReducer and initialState

## 2. Implement useGameState custom hook [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a custom hook that provides access to the game state and dispatch function throughout the application.
### Details:
Create a new file `useGameState.js` that:
1. Imports the GameContext
2. Exports a useGameState hook that uses useContext to access the game state and dispatch function
3. Includes error handling for when the hook is used outside of a GameProvider
4. Returns an object with the current state and dispatch function

## 3. Implement game action hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create custom hooks for game actions including initialization, player turns, computer turns, and game completion.
### Details:
Create a new file `gameActionHooks.js` that exports:
1. useGameInitialization - handles setting up a new game with initial albums
2. usePlayerTurn - manages player selection and turn completion
3. useComputerTurn - implements AI logic for computer's turn
4. useGameCompletion - handles game ending conditions and determining the winner

Each hook should use the useGameState hook and return the necessary functions to perform its actions.

## 4. Implement game state persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Add functionality to save and load game state using localStorage to allow resuming games.
### Details:
Enhance the GameProvider to:
1. Load saved game state from localStorage on initial render
2. Save game state to localStorage whenever it changes using useEffect
3. Add new reducer actions for SAVE_GAME and LOAD_GAME
4. Create utility functions saveGameState and loadGameState
5. Implement a mechanism to detect and handle corrupted or invalid saved states

## 5. Connect game state to UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Integrate the game state management with UI components to create a functional game flow.
### Details:
1. Update App.js to wrap the application with GameProvider
2. Modify existing game components to use the useGameState hook instead of local state
3. Connect player interaction events to the appropriate game action hooks
4. Implement UI feedback based on game state (current turn, scores, game status)
5. Add a game control panel with buttons for starting a new game, saving, and loading
6. Create a GameHistory component to display the history of moves using the gameHistory state
