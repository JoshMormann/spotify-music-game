# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Album Selection Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an intuitive interface for browsing and selecting albums from the player's collection.
# Details:
Implement the album selection interface with the following features:

1. Scrollable album shelf displaying all 12 albums in the player's hand
2. Hover effects to highlight available albums
3. Click interaction to select an album
4. Visual indication of selected album
5. Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

```jsx
const AlbumSelectionInterface = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useGameContext();
  const { playerAlbums, selectedAlbum, currentTurn } = state;
  
  const handleAlbumSelect = (album) => {
    if (currentTurn !== 'player') return;
    dispatch({ type: 'SELECT_ALBUM', payload: album });
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="album-selection-container">
      <h2>Your Album Collection</h2>
      <AlbumShelf>
        {playerAlbums.map((album) => (
          <AlbumCover
            key={album.id}
            coverUrl={album.coverArt}
            onClick={() => handleAlbumSelect(album)}
            className={selectedAlbum?.id === album.id ? 'selected' : ''}
          >
            <AlbumInfo>
              <AlbumTitle>{album.name}</AlbumTitle>
              <AlbumArtist>{album.artist}</AlbumArtist>
            </AlbumInfo>
          </AlbumCover>
        ))}
      </AlbumShelf>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Implement smooth animations for album selection and deselection. Add tooltips showing album title and artist on hover.

# Test Strategy:
Test the interface with different album collections to ensure proper display. Verify that album selection works correctly and updates the game state. Test keyboard navigation for accessibility. Conduct usability testing to ensure the interface is intuitive and responsive across different devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create AlbumShelf and AlbumCover Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core components for displaying albums in a scrollable shelf with proper styling and layout.
### Details:
Create styled components for AlbumShelf (container) and AlbumCover (individual album). Style AlbumShelf as a horizontal scrollable container with flex layout. Style AlbumCover to display album artwork with appropriate dimensions, border-radius, and box-shadow. Implement responsive design using media queries to adjust album size and shelf layout for different screen sizes.

## 2. Implement Album Hover Effects and Tooltips [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add hover effects to highlight available albums and implement tooltips showing album title and artist on hover.
### Details:
Enhance the AlbumCover component with hover effects using CSS transitions for scale and shadow changes. Create a Tooltip component that displays album information on hover. Position the tooltip appropriately relative to the album cover. Include album title and artist in the tooltip with styled typography. Ensure tooltips don't overflow viewport boundaries.

## 3. Implement Album Selection Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add click interaction to select albums and update the game state accordingly.
### Details:
Implement the handleAlbumSelect function to dispatch the SELECT_ALBUM action with the selected album as payload. Add conditional logic to prevent album selection when it's not the player's turn. Create a visual indication for the selected album by applying a 'selected' class with distinctive styling (e.g., highlighted border, elevation change). Ensure only one album can be selected at a time.

## 4. Add Animation for Album Selection and Deselection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement smooth animations when albums are selected or deselected to enhance user experience.
### Details:
Use CSS transitions or React animation libraries (like framer-motion) to animate album selection/deselection. Animate properties like scale, position, and shadow to create a satisfying interaction. Implement different animations for selection vs. deselection. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts. Add appropriate timing and easing functions for natural-feeling animations.

## 5. Integrate AlbumInfo Component with Album Details [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and integrate the AlbumInfo component to display album metadata (title and artist) within the album covers.
### Details:
Implement the AlbumInfo, AlbumTitle, and AlbumArtist components with appropriate styling. Position the AlbumInfo component within AlbumCover to show metadata on hover or permanently based on design requirements. Style text for readability against various album cover backgrounds (consider text shadow or semi-transparent background). Implement text truncation for long titles/artist names with ellipsis.
