# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Spotify OAuth Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create authentication flow using Spotify OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log in with their Spotify credentials and access their music library.
# Details:
Create an authentication service with the following features:

1. Implement Spotify OAuth 2.0 flow:
   - Create login button on home screen
   - Redirect to Spotify authorization page
   - Handle callback with authorization code
   - Exchange code for access and refresh tokens
   - Store tokens securely in local storage

2. Request appropriate scopes:
   - user-read-recently-played
   - user-library-read

3. Implement token refresh mechanism:
   - Check token expiration before API calls
   - Use refresh token to get new access token
   - Update stored tokens

4. Create authentication state management:
   - Track login status
   - Provide user context to app
   - Handle logout functionality

Implement persistent login across sessions by checking for valid tokens on app startup.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow with valid and invalid credentials. Verify token storage and retrieval. Test token refresh mechanism. Ensure login state persists between sessions. Verify proper error handling for authentication failures.
