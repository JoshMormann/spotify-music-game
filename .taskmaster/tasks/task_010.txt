# Details:
Implement track selection interface with the following features:

1. Track card component:
```jsx
const TrackCard = ({ track, isSelected, onSelect }) => (
  <div className={`track-card ${isSelected ? 'selected' : ''}`} onClick={onSelect}>
    <img src={track.album.images[0].url} alt={track.album.name} />
    <div className="track-info">
      <h3>{track.name}</h3>
      <p>{track.artists.map(a => a.name).join(', ')}</p>
      <p>{track.album.name}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

2. Hand visualization:
   - Scrollable horizontal list of track cards
   - Grid view option for larger screens
   - Visual indication of selected track
   - Hover effects for interactive elements

3. Track details display:
   - Click/tap to select track
   - Long press or secondary click for detailed view
   - Show relevant track metadata based on current prompt

4. Selection confirmation:
   - Clear visual feedback when track is selected
   - Confirmation button to finalize selection
   - Option to change selection before confirmation

5. Accessibility considerations:
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Touch targets of appropriate size

# Test Strategy:
Test track selection with mouse, touch, and keyboard. Verify selected state is clearly visible. Test scrolling behavior with various hand sizes. Verify track details are displayed correctly. Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Conduct usability testing to ensure intuitive interaction.
