Recovery strategies:\n   - Implement automatic retry for transient errors\n   - Provide manual retry options for user\n   - Fallback to cached data when appropriate\n   - Clear route to reset application state\n\n5. User feedback for errors:\n   - Show appropriate error messages\n   - Provide actionable recovery steps\n   - Maintain application usability during partial failures\n   - Implement offline mode detection and messaging",
      "testStrategy": "Test error handling with simulated API failures. Verify error boundaries contain component crashes. Test recovery mechanisms for various error types. Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable. Test offline recovery when connection is restored. Verify logging captures sufficient information for debugging.",
