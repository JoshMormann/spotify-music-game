# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Spotify API Integration Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service layer to interact with Spotify Web API, handling data fetching, error handling, and rate limiting.
# Details:
Implement a Spotify service with the following features:

1. Create API client wrapper:
   - Initialize with authentication tokens
   - Handle API endpoints for user data, tracks, and audio features
   - Implement proper error handling

2. Implement data fetching methods:
   - getUserProfile(): Get basic user information
   - getRecentlyPlayed(): Fetch user's recently played tracks
   - getSavedTracks(): Fetch user's saved/liked tracks
   - getTrackDetails(): Get detailed information about specific tracks
   - getAudioFeatures(): Get audio analysis data for tracks

3. Implement caching strategy:
   - Cache API responses in memory
   - Implement cache invalidation logic
   - Add timestamp to cached data

4. Handle API rate limits:
   - Implement request throttling
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Queue requests when approaching rate limits

5. Error handling:
   - Categorize API errors (auth, network, rate limit)
   - Implement appropriate recovery strategies
   - Provide meaningful error messages to UI

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each API method with mock responses. Test error handling with simulated API failures. Verify caching mechanism works correctly. Test rate limit handling. Integration test with actual Spotify API using test account.
