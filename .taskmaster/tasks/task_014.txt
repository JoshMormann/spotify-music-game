# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize application performance to ensure responsive gameplay with minimal loading times.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations with the following techniques:

1. Image optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for album art
   - Use appropriate image sizes based on display area
   - Implement image caching
   - Use image placeholders during loading

2. Code splitting and lazy loading:
   - Split application into logical chunks
   - Lazy load non-critical components
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Preload critical assets

3. API call optimization:
   - Batch API requests where possible
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Use pagination for large data sets
   - Implement request cancellation for abandoned views

4. Rendering optimization:
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement virtualized lists for large collections
   - Optimize component re-renders
   - Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

5. Performance monitoring:
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Track key user interactions
   - Monitor API response times
   - Set up alerts for performance regressions

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare load times before and after optimizations. Test application performance on various devices and connection speeds. Use Lighthouse or similar tools to verify performance metrics. Test with large data sets to verify scaling. Monitor memory usage during extended gameplay sessions.
