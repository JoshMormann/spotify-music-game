# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Core Gameplay Loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main gameplay loop with rounds, prompts, track selection, comparison, and winner determination.
# Details:
Implement core gameplay loop with the following components:

1. Round initialization:
   - Select random prompt from prompt pool
   - Display prompt to players
   - Set round timer (if applicable)

2. Track selection phase:
   - Allow human player to select track from hand
   - Computer player selects track based on prompt
   - Display selected tracks

3. Comparison logic:
   - Implement comparison functions for each prompt type:
     - popularity: Compare track.popularity values
     - release_date: Compare track.release_date values
     - duration: Compare track.duration_ms values
     - title_length: Compare track.name.length values
     - explicit: Check track.explicit flag
     - featured_artists: Count track.artists.length
   - Handle tie-breaking logic

4. Round resolution:
   - Determine winner based on comparison
   - Update scores
   - Display winning track with explanation
   - Play winning track
   - Add round to history

5. Game progression:
   - Check if any player has reached 10 points
   - If yes, end game and declare winner
   - If no, start new round with new prompt

Implement tie handling by replaying the round with a new prompt.

# Test Strategy:
Test each comparison function with various track data. Verify correct winner determination for each prompt type. Test tie-breaking logic. Test game progression and end conditions. Verify round history is correctly maintained. Test with simulated gameplay scenarios.
