# MVP Gameplay Loop & Future PvP Path

## MVP Gameplay Loop

The MVP version of UMG Track Battle will focus on delivering a compelling Player vs Computer (PvC) experience with Spotify integration. The core gameplay loop has been refined to incorporate the new requirements:

### 1. User Authentication & Hand Generation
- User logs in with Spotify credentials
- App requests permission to access recently played tracks
- System fetches user's 50 most recently played tracks
- System identifies and selects the 12 most recently played albums/EPs
- These 12 albums become the player's "hand"

### 2. Game Initialization
- Computer player is assigned a static hand of 12 pre-selected UMG albums
- Game board is displayed with both players' album collections
- Player's albums are fully visible to them
- Computer's albums are displayed with album art visible
- Initial score is set to 0-0

### 3. Player's Turn (First Turn)
- Player selects an album from their collection
- Album expands to show available tracks
- Player selects a track from the album
- Player selects a challenge category (Top Chart Rank, Most Plays, etc.)
- Selected track begins playing (simulated in MVP)
- Track and challenge category are displayed on the virtual turntable

### 4. Computer's Counter Play
- Computer analyzes the challenge category
- Computer selects an album and track optimized for the challenge
- Computer's track is displayed on the virtual turntable
- Both tracks are compared based on the selected challenge category
- Winner is determined and point is awarded
- Detailed explanation of the outcome is displayed

### 5. Computer's Turn
- Computer selects an album, track, and challenge category
- Selected track is displayed on the virtual turntable
- Player is prompted to counter

### 6. Player's Counter Play
- Player selects an album and track to counter
- Both tracks are compared based on the challenge category
- Winner is determined and point is awarded
- Detailed explanation of the outcome is displayed

### 7. Game Continuation
- Steps 3-6 repeat, with players alternating who initiates each round
- Current scores are continuously updated
- Previously played tracks are marked or removed from selection

### 8. Game Conclusion
- First player to reach 10 points wins
- Game summary is displayed
- Option to play again is presented

## Key Differences Between MVP and Full PvP

| Feature | MVP (PvC) | Full PvP |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Player 2 Hand | Static, pre-selected albums | Dynamic, based on opponent's listening history |
| Turn Management | Immediate computer response | Asynchronous, wait for opponent |
| Game Persistence | Single session | Persistent across sessions |
| Matchmaking | N/A | Random or friend-based |
| Social Features | None | Friend system, chat, sharing |
| Authentication | Spotify login only | Full user accounts |

## Implementation Priorities

The development roadmap prioritizes:

1. Solid core gameplay experience in MVP
2. Scalable architecture that supports future PvP
3. User-friendly Spotify integration
4. Engaging computer opponent for MVP
5. Clear path to PvP with minimal rework

By focusing on these priorities, the MVP will deliver an engaging standalone experience while establishing the foundation for the full PvP vision.
