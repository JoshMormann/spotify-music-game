# Player 2 (Computer) Hand Strategy

## MVP Approach: Static Album Hand

For the MVP version of UMG Track Battle, Player 2 will be controlled by the computer and will use a static set of albums and tracks. This approach provides several advantages:

1. **Predictable Gameplay**: A curated set of albums ensures balanced gameplay
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need for dynamic data fetching for the computer player
3. **Faster Development**: Allows for quicker implementation and testing
4. **Controlled Challenge Level**: Can be designed with appropriate difficulty

### Static Hand Implementation

The static hand for Player 2 will consist of:

1. **Album Selection**: 12 carefully selected albums from the UMG catalog that:
   - Represent diverse genres and eras
   - Include both highly popular and more niche selections
   - Contain tracks with varied attributes (chart positions, play counts, release dates)
   - Feature iconic and recognizable album artwork

2. **Data Structure**: Each album in the static hand will have:
   - Complete metadata (artist, title, release date)
   - Full track listings with all required attributes
   - Pre-populated challenge category data (Billboard ranks, play counts, etc.)

3. **Computer AI Strategy**:
   - Basic algorithm to select tracks based on the current challenge category
   - Prioritize tracks with strong attributes for the active challenge
   - Include some randomness to prevent predictable play patterns

### Example Static Hand Albums

The static hand could include iconic UMG albums such as:
- "Thriller" by Michael Jackson
- "Rumours" by Fleetwood Mac
- "Abbey Road" by The Beatles
- "Back in Black" by AC/DC
- "Nevermind" by Nirvana
- "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd
- "1989" by Taylor Swift
- "Lemonade" by Beyonc√©
- "To Pimp a Butterfly" by Kendrick Lamar
- "Purple Rain" by Prince
- "Appetite for Destruction" by Guns N' Roses
- "Random Access Memories" by Daft Punk

## Future PvP Expansion

The game architecture will be designed to easily transition from PvC (Player vs Computer) to PvP (Player vs Player) in future updates.

### PvP Implementation Strategy

1. **Matchmaking System**:
   - Random matchmaking similar to Words with Friends
   - Option to challenge friends directly
   - Potential for ranked matchmaking based on skill level

2. **Dynamic Hands for Both Players**:
   - Both players' hands will be generated from their Spotify listening history
   - Same album hand logic applies to both players
   - Ensures unique and personalized gameplay for each match

3. **Asynchronous Gameplay**:
   - Players can take turns at their convenience
   - Push notifications when it's the player's turn
   - Game state persistence between sessions

4. **Social Features**:
   - Friend system integration
   - Option to add opponents as Spotify friends
   - In-game chat functionality
   - Sharing match results on social media

### Technical Considerations for PvP

1. **Backend Requirements**:
   - User authentication and session management
   - Game state storage in database
   - WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
   - API endpoints for game actions

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Clear consent for sharing listening history in gameplay
   - Options to limit visibility of listening history
   - Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

3. **Scalability**:
   - Architecture that supports concurrent games
   - Efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Transition Path from MVP to PvP

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Player vs Computer with static hand
   - Focus on core gameplay mechanics
   - Spotify login and dynamic hand for Player 1 only
   - Computer opponent with static hand

2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced PvC Experience
   - Improved computer AI
   - Expanded static album catalog
   - Difficulty levels for computer opponent

3. **Phase 3**: Limited PvP Beta
   - Friend-only PvP matches
   - Basic matchmaking
   - Core PvP functionality

4. **Phase 4**: Full PvP Release
   - Random matchmaking
   - Leaderboards and rankings
   - Complete social features

5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Features
   - Tournaments and events
   - Seasonal content
   - Enhanced social features

## Implementation Priorities

For the MVP, the focus should be on:
1. Solid implementation of the static hand for Player 2
2. Basic computer AI for track selection
3. Clear UI distinction between human and computer players
4. Architecture that supports future PvP expansion

The static hand approach provides a controlled environment for testing and refining the core gameplay mechanics while setting the foundation for future PvP functionality.
